# Canvas Particle Effects

This project contains an example of creating interactive particle effects using the HTML canvas element. The particles are animated and respond to user interactions such as mouse clicks and movements.

## Particle Effect Example

The example demonstrates how to draw and animate particles on the canvas, creating a dynamic and interactive visual effect. The particles change color based on the hue value, which is incremented over time to produce a colorful animation.

### Files

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and JavaScript code for creating and animating the particles.

### How It Works

1. A `canvas` element is used as the drawing surface.
2. When the user clicks or moves the mouse on the canvas, new particles are generated at the mouse position.
3. Each particle has random properties such as size, speed, and color.
4. The particles move and shrink over time, and lines are drawn between particles that are close to each other.
5. The animation runs continuously, clearing and redrawing the canvas in each frame to create the effect.

This example demonstrates basic principles of working with the canvas API and can be extended with additional features and effects.

## Usage

To see the particle effect in action, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Move the mouse and click on the canvas to generate particles and observe the animations.
