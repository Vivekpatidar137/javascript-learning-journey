# Custom Video Player Example

## Summary

This project demonstrates how to create a custom video player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features custom controls for play, pause, stop, rewind, and fast forward, along with a timer and progress bar.

## Description

### Understanding of Audio and Video API

The HTML5 `<video>` element provides a standard way to embed video content in a web page. This project extends the functionality of the default video player by creating custom controls using JavaScript. The controls include play, pause, stop, rewind, and fast forward buttons. 

### Project Structure

- **`index.html`**: Contains the HTML structure for the video player, including the video element and custom control buttons.
- **`style.css`**: Defines the styles for the video player and custom controls, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing interface.
- **`custom-player.js`**: Adds functionality to the custom controls, enabling play, pause, stop, rewind, and fast forward actions.
- **`video/`**: Contains the video file (`sintel-short.mp4`) used in the player.
- **`fonts/`**: Contains the font files for the custom control icons.

### Features

- **Custom Controls**: Custom buttons for play, pause, stop, rewind, and fast forward.
- **Timer**: Displays the current time of the video and a progress bar indicating the playback progress.
- **Accessibility**: Custom controls are accessible via keyboard for improved usability.

### Usage

To use this project, clone the repository and open `index.html` in a web browser. The custom video player should appear with custom controls that can be used to interact with the video.
