# Owlbear Forest Adventure

## Overview
"Owlbear Forest Adventure" is a simple 2D game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows you to control an Owlbear character that moves around the canvas environment, interacting with various elements like plants, bushes, and grass. The project demonstrates essential JavaScript concepts in game development, such as handling user input, rendering on canvas, sprite animations, and managing game states.

## Features
- **Character Control:** Use the arrow keys to move the Owlbear character around the canvas.
- **Canvas Rendering:** Utilizes the HTML5 canvas for rendering game elements.
- **Sprite Animations:** Smooth animations for character movements.
- **Interactive Environment:** Randomly placed plants, bushes, and grass on the canvas.
- **Collision Boundaries:** Keeps the Owlbear character within the game boundaries.

## JavaScript Concepts Demonstrated
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Classes are used to represent game elements like the Owlbear, bushes, plants, and the overall game logic, encapsulating related data and behavior.
- **Event Handling:** Keyboard events (`keydown` and `keyup`) are used to control the Owlbear's movement.
- **Canvas API:** Drawing and updating game elements on the canvas using `getContext('2d')` and various drawing methods.
- **Sprite Animation:** Implements frame-based animation by cycling through sprite frames using a timer.
- **Game Loop:** Utilizes `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations and updates, demonstrating how to create a continuous game loop.
- **Dynamic Object Management:** Adds and updates objects dynamically, including handling their positions and rendering order for a layered appearance.

## Learning Objectives
- Utilize the HTML5 canvas element for dynamic 2D rendering.
- Learn to handle user inputs for interactive control of game objects.
- Implement sprite-based animations using JavaScript.
- Practice structuring code with classes for modular and scalable game development.
- Explore game loop mechanics using `requestAnimationFrame`.
