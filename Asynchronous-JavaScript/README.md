# Asynchronous JavaScript - Sequencing Animations

## Summary
This project demonstrates the use of asynchronous JavaScript to sequence animations. It showcases how to animate multiple elements in a specific order using promises and async/await syntax.

## Description
The example consists of three images of Alice, each performing a tumbling animation one after the other. The animations are controlled using JavaScript's `animate()` method, and the sequencing is handled using promises and async/await syntax.

The HTML file sets up the structure with three images placed in a grid layout. The CSS file styles the elements, providing a visually appealing background and layout for the animations. The JavaScript file contains the logic to animate the images in sequence, ensuring that each animation starts only after the previous one has finished.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the project.
- `style.css`: Includes the CSS styling for the project.
- `main.js`: Contains the JavaScript code to sequence the animations.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, including its purpose and file structure.

## Usage
To view the animation, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The images of Alice will animate in sequence, demonstrating the use of asynchronous JavaScript for sequencing animations.

## Learning Points
- Using the `animate()` method to perform animations on HTML elements.
- Sequencing animations using promises and async/await syntax.
- Styling elements with CSS to create a visually appealing layout.

This project is a simple yet effective demonstration of how asynchronous JavaScript can be used to control the timing of animations, providing a foundation for more complex animation sequences in web development.
